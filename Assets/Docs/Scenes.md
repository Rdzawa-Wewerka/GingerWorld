# Scenes

Project is using multiple scenes.

You can easily load multi-scene preset using SceneWindow (`Window -> SceneWindow`). The presets are also used to load scenes in game.

To create new multi-scene preset select in assets context menu `Multi Scene Setup -> Create` to save the current multi-scene setup (What scenes are currently opened).

Quick notes:

-   `Core` - this scene won't be unloaded and is loaded on start for game.
